# Summary
This document is intended to help me map out a personal learning plan.
(personal evaluation statement here)  

# Goals
1. Grow as a data scientist. Specifically the application and tuning of neural networks & building intelligent systems.
1. Attain an understanding of computer science equivalent to a holder of a masters degree from a top university.
1. Attain a familiarity with the mathematic principles covered in an undergraduate ms/cs degree.
1. Attain the skillset of a mid-level software engineer. 
1. Have fun!

# Philosophy
I believe I can reach the above goals by applying a mixed breadth and depth strategy 
where I develop familiarity with a broad range of topics, and go deep on those that either:
  - Are particularly interesting to me
  - Support my learning goals in several ways exs:
    - I'll spend quite a bit of time on algorithms, because they support goals 1-5 above.
    - I'll spend less time on say, operating system design, as it supports only goal 2, and is not within my target subdomain (ml/ai).

# Methodology
1. Finish 1 task every three weeks
1. Use top-level university programs when posssible
1. Opt for classes that produce a tangible product tha can be displayed within this repo.
1. Given two classes, take the harder one if it adresses more than one goal, else the easier one.
1. Use books as supplements to classes rather than replacements.

# Curriculum
