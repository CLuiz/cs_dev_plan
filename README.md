# cs_dev_plan
My personal development past, present, and future in regards to computer science, data science, math, etc. 

Both format and large portions of content have been taken from the OSSU computer science curriculum found here:
https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/README.md.

I have used the base classes for the open source cs degree as an evaluation baseline, and will work towards proficiency
in each topic as listed below.  I will note when a class has been completed, or if I have evaluated and skipped
it based on my current skill and/or previous education.

# Summary
This document is intended to help me map out a personal learning plan.
(personal evaluation statement here)  

# Goals
1. Grow as a data scientist. Specifically the application and tuning of neural networks & building intelligent systems.
1. Attain an understanding of computer science equivalent to a holder of a masters degree from a top university.
1. Attain a familiarity with the mathematic principles covered in an undergraduate ms/cs degree.
1. Improve my skills in regards to general software engineering. 
1. Have fun!

# Philosophy
I believe I can reach the above goals by applying a mixed breadth and depth strategy 
where I develop familiarity with a broad range of topics, and go deep on those that either:
  - Are particularly interesting to me
  - Support my learning goals in several ways exs:
    - I'll spend quite a bit of time on algorithms, because they support goals 1-5 above.
    - I'll spend less time on say, operating system design, as it supports only goal 2, and is not within my target subdomain (ml/ai).

# Methodology
1. Finish 1 task every three weeks
1. Use top-level university programs when posssible
1. Opt for classes that produce a tangible product tha can be displayed within this repo.
1. Given two classes, take the harder one if it adresses more than one goal, else the easier one.
1. Use books as supplements to classes rather than replacements.

# Curriculum
## Introduction to Computer Science
These courses will introduce you to the world of computer science.
Both are required, but feel free to skip straight to the second course when CS50 (the first course) moves away from C.

## Advanced CS

After completing **every required course** in Core CS, students should choose a subset of courses from Advanced CS based on interest.
Not every course from a subcategory needs to be taken.
But students should take *every* course that is relevant to the field they intend to go into.

The Advanced CS study should then end with one of the Specializations under [Advanced applications](#advanced-applications).
A Specialization's Capstone, if taken, may act as the [Final project](#final-project), if permitted by the Honor Code of the course.
If not, or if a student chooses not to take the Capstone, then a separate Final project will need to be done to complete this curriculum.

### Advanced programming

**Topics covered**:
`debugging theory and practice`
`goal-oriented programming`
